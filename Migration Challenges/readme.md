# New Token Launch Strategy: Balancing Holder Trust and Market Stability

The process of launching a new token with a migration strategy for existing holders presents a unique set of dynamics in terms of trust and market perception. Here's a detailed explanation of the scenario described, with a focus on the distribution of tokens among existing holders versus new participants, and the implications of token allocation on market stability and trust.


## Initial Token Distribution Ratio

In the given scenario, there is a migration trust ratio of 12/88 for the new token launch. This means that 12% of the tokens are allocated to new holders, while the remaining 88% are retained by existing holders from a previous iteration or version of the token. Such a distribution indicates a strong preference or weight towards existing holders, which is a common strategy to preserve loyalty and reward long-term supporters.

## Launch Circulation and Unreleased Supply

At the launch, only 33% of the total token supply is set to be in circulation. The rest, which amounts to 67%, remains unreleased. This decision impacts market dynamics significantly. From the 33% circulating supply, the portion attributed to new holders (as derived from the 12/88 ratio) adjusts to an 8/92 ratio when considering that only a third of the tokens are being released. This further emphasizes the dominance of existing holders in the early market.

## Market Perception and Trust Issues

The structure where only a third of the tokens are initially available for trading, while two-thirds remain controlled by the entity behind the token, raises concerns among holders. There's a fear that the unreleased tokens, making up 66% of the total supply, could be deployed in ways that dilute valueâ€”such as through pairings or giveaways. The idea here is that any tokens introduced to the market should ideally come from "paid" sources (i.e., bought by new holders) rather than being freely distributed from the unreleased supply, to avoid devaluing the tokens already in circulation.

## Potential Market Movements

Given this setup, there's an expectation that the token's value might initially surge (potentially 2-3 times) as interest peaks with the relaunch, but could fall below its launch price within two weeks if unreleased tokens are introduced into the market. This potential decrease in value is tied to the fear that a significant portion of the supply could be sold off, especially if existing holders decide to cash out at the all-time high prices following the relaunch.


## Summary: Navigating Holder Dynamics and Market Stability

The strategy of having a majority of tokens held by existing stakeholders can instill a sense of continuity and trust among the community. However, the approach to managing the unreleased supply is critical. Transparency regarding how and when the unreleased tokens will be distributed, along with ensuring that any market introduction of these tokens is carefully managed, can help mitigate fears of market dilution and value loss.

The challenge lies in balancing the interests and perceptions of both new and existing holders. Ensuring that existing holders do not rapidly sell off their tokens while also making the token attractive to new investors requires a careful strategy that prioritizes transparency, equitable growth, and market stability.
