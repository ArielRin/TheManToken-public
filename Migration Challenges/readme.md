# New Token Launch Strategy: Balancing Holder Trust and Market Stability

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy and considerations for the launch of a new token, emphasizing the distribution between existing holders and new participants. Our approach is designed to maintain loyalty among current holders while attracting new investment, ensuring market stability and trust throughout the relaunch process.

### Initial Token Distribution Ratio
- **Migration Trust Ratio:** 12/88, indicating that 12% of the tokens are allocated to new holders, while 88% are retained by existing holders.
- **Objective:** Reward long-term supporters and maintain a strong base of existing holders.

### Launch Circulation and Unreleased Supply
- **Circulation at Launch:** 33% of the total token supply.
- **Unreleased Supply:** 67%, to be strategically introduced to the market.
- **Adjusted Ratio for Launch:** From the circulating supply, the distribution adjusts to an 8/92 ratio in favor of existing holders.

### Market Perception and Trust Issues
- Concerns arise with two-thirds of the token supply being controlled and potentially introduced to the market post-launch.
- **Strategy:** Ensure any market introduction of unreleased tokens comes from "paid" sources to prevent dilution of value.

### Potential Market Movements
- **Initial Surge:** Expectations of a 2-3x increase in token value post-relaunch.
- **Subsequent Stability:** A potential fall below launch prices if unreleased tokens are not managed prudently.

## Strategy for Navigating Holder Dynamics

### Transparency and Communication
- Clearly communicate how and when unreleased tokens will be distributed.
- Engage with both existing and potential new holders to build trust and manage expectations.

### Balancing Interests
- **Existing Holders:** Implement measures to discourage rapid sell-off post-relaunch.
- **New Investors:** Make the token attractive through clear value propositions and growth potential.

### Market Stability Measures
- Introduce unreleased tokens to the market in a controlled manner.
- Monitor market reactions and adjust strategies accordingly to maintain stability and confidence.

## Conclusion
Our token launch strategy is designed to balance the dynamics between rewarding existing holders and attracting new investment. By managing the introduction of unreleased tokens with care and maintaining open communication, we aim to ensure a stable and trustworthy market environment. Our commitment to transparency and strategic planning underpins our approach to achieving sustainable growth and long-term value for all stakeholders.
