# Obscure Pairing and Liquidity in AMMs



## Overview

The proposition to utilize an arbitrage platform to enhance liquidity through obscure token pairs in an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model faces significant practical challenges that need to be addressed.

## Definition of an Obscure Pair

An "obscure pair" in the context of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a trading pair composed of two tokens that are not widely traded or known, and both tokens often have transaction taxes applied to them. These pairs typically have low trading volumes, low liquidity, and higher volatility compared to more popular trading pairs. They might include tokens from niche projects, newly launched tokens, or tokens that are not listed on major exchanges. The presence of transaction taxes on both tokens in the pair further exacerbates the challenges, as these taxes significantly increase the cost of trading, discourage trading activity, and contribute to the pair's low liquidity and high volatility.


## Key Challenges

### 1. Selection of Obscure Token Pairs
- **Low Likelihood of Selection:** AMMs typically prioritize pairs with higher trading volumes and liquidity due to greater stability and less slippage.
- **Volatility:** Obscure pairs are characterized by lower liquidity and higher volatility, making them less attractive to both AMMs and traders.

### 2. Compounding Effect and Market Realities
- **Price Impact:** Swapping tokens in an illiquid pair often leads to significant price impacts, which can negate potential benefits of compounded liquidity.
- **Unstable Market Conditions:** Each trade in obscure pairs can drastically change the price, leading to an unstable market.

### 3. Transaction Taxes
- **High Transaction Costs:** Tokens in a pair with high transaction taxes significantly increase the overall cost for traders.
- **Discouraged Trading Activity:** Increased transaction costs can discourage trading activity, leading to even lower liquidity.

### 4. Contribution to Total Value Locked (TVL)
- **Negligible Contribution:** Obscure pairs with low liquidity contribute little to the overall liquidity and TVL of a project.
- **Trading Preferences:** Most trading activity occurs in pools with higher liquidity, typically involving a project's native token.
- **Misleading Perception:** Without specific frontend adjustments, the real contribution of these pairs may not be accurately represented, leading to a misleading perception of market strength.

## Conclusion

While the concept of using an arbitrage platform in conjunction with AMMs to enhance liquidity through obscure token pairs is innovative, its practical execution and effectiveness are highly doubtful. The natural trading dynamics, coupled with the operational principles of AMMs, suggest that such a strategy might not be viable in achieving the intended liquidity enhancement and value compounding.
