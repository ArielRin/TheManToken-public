# Liquidity Issue in Newer Reflection Style Contracts


 New taxation models originating from launchpad released contracts can significantly impact the incentives and overall feasibility of becoming a liquidity provider (LP). This discussion contrasts two distinct scenarios: one where heavy taxes are levied on all aspects of liquidity provision and another where taxes are strategically applied only to buy and sell transactions, sparing liquidity-related activities.

## Scenario with Comprehensive Tokenomic Taxes:

In this scenario, a token imposes an 8% tax on all transactions, including buying, selling, adding to liquidity pools, and removing liquidity. This approach has several key impacts on liquidity providers:

- Initial Purchase and Sale: Investors see an immediate reduction in their investment value due to the 8% tax applied when buying the token. Similarly, when selling tokens, they are hit again by the tax, diminishing the final return on their investment.

- Adding and Removing Liquidity: Each time Liquidity Providers (LP's) add their tokens to a liquidity pool or decide to withdraw their liquidity, they incur the transaction tax. This not only reduces the value of their contribution to the pool but also eats into the profits they might earn from transaction fees within the pool.

liquidity providers (LPs) face a transaction tax specifically when removing their tokens from a liquidity pool, with an important distinction: the tax impacts not just the token with the imposed tax rate but also the native or paired token at the time of withdrawal. This tax does not apply during the addition of liquidity, However the situation changes upon liquidity removal.

- Tax on Withdrawal further considerations: When Liquidity Providers (LP's) decide to withdraw their liquidity, the transaction tax is applied to both the specific taxed token and the paired native token. This tax is levied at the rate of the taxed token, effectively reducing the total value that LPs can reclaim from the pool. This approach ensures that the initial contribution to the pool is not taxed, but the withdrawal process subjects both tokens to the taxation, affecting the overall returns from liquidity provision.

- Impact on Profitability: The imposition of the tax at the point of removal directly affects the profitability of being a liquidity provider. While Liquidity Providers (LP's) can accrue transaction fees from the pool's trading activity without tax implications on those earnings, the eventual withdrawal tax reduces the net gains. This diminished profitability can make liquidity provision less appealing, as the tax erodes a portion of the returns that would otherwise incentivize participation in liquidity pools.

- Fee Earnings: Profits earned from swap fees in the pool are also subject to taxation, further reducing the attractiveness of liquidity provision as an investment strategy.

The compounded effect of these taxes can lead to a significant loss in token value, potentially up to 48%, from the initial investment through to the eventual sale of the tokens. This heavy tax burden makes liquidity provision unattractive and unfeasible for many investors, thereby harming the liquidity and overall health of the token ecosystem.

## Scenario with Taxes Only on Buy and Sell Transactions:

Conversely, consider a tokenomics model where taxes are applied only to the initial purchase and final sale of tokens, with no taxes on liquidity provision activities. This model creates a more favorable environment for liquidity providers:

- Initial Purchase and Sale: As in the previous scenario, investors are taxed on the purchase and sale of tokens. While this reduces the immediate value of their investment and the final return, it's the only point at which taxes are applied.

- Adding and Removing Liquidity: In stark contrast to the comprehensive tax model, adding to or withdrawing from liquidity pools is not taxed. This encourages more investors to become LPs, as they can contribute the full value of their tokens to the pool and withdraw their entire position, including earned fees, without a tax penalty.

- Fee Earnings: LPs enjoy the full benefits of fee earnings from pool transactions without deductions for taxes. This direct incentive supports a robust liquidity provision, ensuring that the market remains liquid and efficient.

This taxation strategy fosters a more sustainable and attractive ecosystem for liquidity providers. By sparing them from taxes on liquidity-related activities, it ensures that the provision of liquidity is a viable and profitable endeavor. This approach not only benefits LPs but also enhances the overall market dynamics by ensuring ample liquidity, which is essential for the efficient operation of DeFi platforms.

## Summary:

The contrast between these two scenarios highlights the significant impact of tokenomics and taxation policies on the feasibility and attractiveness of liquidity provision within the DeFi ecosystem. A taxation model that exempts liquidity-related activities from taxes, focusing only on the buy and sell transactions, presents a more balanced and investor-friendly approach. It encourages participation in liquidity provision, supports market efficiency, and contributes to the long-term sustainability of the token ecosystem, benefiting both liquidity providers and the broader DeFi community.
